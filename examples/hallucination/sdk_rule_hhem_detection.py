Dingo Rule-based HHEM-2.1-Open Hallucination Detection Example

This example demonstrates how to use the HHEM-2.1-Open model as a rule-based
hallucination detection tool for efficient local inference without API costs.

Rule-based HHEM offers:
- Better architecture fit (rules vs LLM for deterministic local models)
- Superior performance than GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on benchmarks
- Local inference with <600MB RAM usage
- Fast processing (~1.5s for 2k tokens on modern CPU)
- No API costs or rate limits
